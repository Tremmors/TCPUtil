TCPUtil by John Trimis

This is a simple TCP I/O utility I made because:
1) I need something a little more sophisticated than telnet.
2) I needed to learn async socket programming.

This started out as some demo code from TheCodeProject.com but has been almost completely rewritten.

You can send text and/or binary values by typing them into the left pane.
Binary values need to take the format of <XX> where XX is the hex value to put there.
ex. <D><A> is carriage return linefeed.

Note: This is quite old and is no longer maintained.
